              <p class="card-text" style="text-align:justify">
                Buyer’s consolidations are primarily used to reduce costs for shippers when they are
                handling cargo from multiple suppliers at roughly the same time – usually within a
                period of a few weeks or a month. “Affinity” coordinates bookings with all suppliers as forecasted by our customer. We
                then consolidate cargo from different suppliers at our facilities. We can also create and
                execute an optimized consolidation plan for you, resulting in faster deliveries to the
                destination. We place equal priority on both the optimized flow of goods and the clear flow of
                information. This approach to information flow management enables our customers to
                optimize inventory and obtain clear visibility on their products –from the time the goods
                are received at our facility to their safe delivery in the hands of their customers.</p>

              <p class="card-text" style="text-align:justify">

                Air freight transportation is a fast and efficient shipping
                method that is particularly valuable to businesses needing to
                get products to international customers quickly or stay on
                track with a just-in-time manufacturing model. The primary
                downside of air shipping is that the cost can be significantly
                higher than ocean freight forwarding. Fortunately, Affinity
                Trans Logistics can help lower this cost while also providing
                exceptional customer support.We and our agents around the world have the same goal - to
                provide outstanding service and competitive pricing. Affinity Trans has no interest in being a high-volume, one-
                model-fits-all provider. Our clients are not just numbers, and
                every shipment is given the individual attention to detail it
                requires. While many larger air freight forwarders are bound
                by consolidation schedules, we are able to offer greater
                flexibility for our client’s cargo through seamless quotation
                process, and team of industry experts specializing in Air
                Freight or Air Cargo Services.Our  dependable  worldwide  scheduled   consolidations   and
                door-to-door transportation services ensure shortened lead
                times, providing the security and reliability required by
                today's businesses.</p>

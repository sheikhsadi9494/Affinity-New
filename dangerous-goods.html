            <h3><b>CLASSIFICATION OF DANGEROUS GOODS</b></h3>
            <p>The International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code was developed as a uniform international
                code for the transport of dangerous goods by sea covering such matters as packing, container traffic
                and stowage, with particular reference to the segregation of incompatible substances.</p>
            <p>The Carriage of dangerous goods and marine pollutants in sea-going ships is respectively regulated in
                the International Convention for the Safety of the Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International
                Convention for the Prevention of pollution from Ships (MARPOL).</p>
            <p>Relevant parts of both SOLAS and MARPOL have been worked out in great detail and are included in
                the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, thus making this Code the legal instrument
                for maritime transport of dangerous goods and marine pollutants. As of 1st January 2004, the IMDG
                Code has become a mandatory requirement.</p>
            <p>For all modes of transport (sea, air, rail, road and inland waterways) the classification (grouping) of
                dangerous goods, by type of risk involved, has been drawn up by the UNITED NATIONS Committee of
                Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN).</p>
            
        
            <h3><b>Hazardous Substances Vs Dangerous goods</b></h3>

            <p><span><b>Hazardous Substances</b></span> have the potential to harm human health. They may be solids,
                liquids or gases; they may be pure substances or mixtures.</p>

            <p>Hazardous substances may cause immediate or long-term health effects. Exposure
                could result in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>poisoning;</li>
                <li>irritation;</li>
                <li>chemical burns;</li>
                <li>sensitisation;</li>
                <li>cancer;</li>
                <li>birth defects; or</li>
                <li>diseases of certain organs such as the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys and nervous
                    system.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span><b>Dangerous goods </b></span>are substances that may be corrosive, flammable, explosive,
                spontaneously combustible, toxic, oxidising, or water-reactive. These goods can be
                deadly and can seriously injure or kill people, damage property and the environment.</p>

        <h5>Buyer’s Consolidations</h5>
        <p>Buyer’s consolidations are primarily used to reduce costs for shippers when they are handling cargo from multiple suppliers at roughly the same time – usually within a period of a few weeks or a month.</p>
        <p>“Affinity” coordinates bookings with all suppliers as forecasted by our customer. We then consolidate cargo from different suppliers at our facilities. We can also create and execute an optimized consolidation plan for you, resulting in faster deliveries to the destination.</p>
        <p>We place equal priority on both the optimized flow of goods and the clear flow of information. This approach to information flow management enables our customers to optimize inventory and obtain clear visibility on their products –from the time the goods are received at our facility to their safe delivery in the hands of their customers.</p>

        <h5>Non-containerised load</h5>
        <p>Non containerized, oversized industrial equipment and large machine parts pose challenges in handling and stowing in the supply chain. We are experienced at handling overweight and out of gauge (O.O.G) shipments not suitable for standard containers. So whether you need flat rack or open top containers, flatbeds or other types of special equipment, we can service your needs.</p>
